Learn how to create a new programming language and write your own compiler.

#Learning Phases
In this project, I'll show you how to build a new programming language with any desired grammer. This project is a phasic project which means it is divided into some parts. In the first part I'll cover Lexical Analyser creating and other phases will be described more in the future.

##Starting Point
In this section I'll provide a quick tutorial on how a grammer is written and how everything goes together to build a compiler.

##How a compiler works?
The procedure that takes place in order to build a executable file from a written program in an specific programming language is provided here:

In the first phase, I'll Implement a Lexical Analyser. Building a lexical analyser which is fully executable can take weeks to complete, so there are some softwares that provide some GUI for us to simply declare the desired grammer for the language we are going to build, and then passing this grammer to that software, and finally the output of that software is that Lexical Analyser. 
We can use any programming language to write our grammer code and pass it to that software. But the most common programming languages are Java and C. The software which is used for each is JFlex and Flex respectively. You can download Flex or JFlex from the directories above.
